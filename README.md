# Toeplitz' Visualization
Visualization of the famous unsolved problem by mathematician Otto Toeplitz proposed in 1911.

# The problem
The Toeplitz' Conjecture or inscribed square problem, is an open problem in the field of geometry and topology. It asks whether every Jordan Curve (a simple closed curve) in R^2 contains the vertices of a square.

## More formally: 
Let $\gamma: \mathbb{R}/L\mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ be a simple closed curve. Then &\gamma(\mathbb{R}/L\mathbb{Z})$ inscribes a square. (Terence Tao)

It is widely believed that the conjecture is true, i.e. that it is indeed possible to inscribe a square in every possible Jordan Curve, but the the problem seems to resist being resolved.
The fact that it is a still-open problem fascinates me and that's the reason I wanted to make this visualisation: To lay the intuition for the problem (and make myself believe that it is probably true ;))
